THIS IS THE COMPOSITION OF RICHARD STALLMAN, 2001
SUNG TO THE TUNE OF "BEAT IT"

WHEN YOUR COMPUTER DOESN'T DO WHAT YOU TYPE,
AND HALF THE SCREEN IS COVERED WITH A BIG WHITE STRIPE,
THE VENDOR WON'T PAY ANY MIND TO YOUR GRIPE,
SO BOOT IT_ JUST BOOT IT_

WHEN YOU DISCOVER THAT A PROCESS WON'T DIE,
IF KILL MINUS NINE WON'T WORK THERE'S NOTHING ELSE TO TRY
YOUR JOBS ARE DEAD MEAT, SO KISS 'EM GOODBYE
AND BOOT IT_ 50 HOURS OF WORK,
JUST BOOT IT, BOOT IT
AND IF YOU CAN'T BOOT IT, SHOOT IT!

WHEN YOU REBOOT IT, WORK WILL BE LOST
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THIS WILL COST
JUST BOOT IT_ JUST BOOT IT_
JUST BOOT IT_ JUST BOOT IT_

WHEN ALL THE CHARACTERS ARE COMING OUT WEIRD,
AND WON'T COME BACK RIGHT EVEN WHEN THE SCREEN IS CLEARED,
YOU CAN'T FIX SUCH THINGS BY TUGGING YOUR BEARD
SO BOOT IT_ JUST BOOT IT_

IF YOUR COMPUTER STILL IS RUNNING WINDOWS,
AND EVERY TIME IT CRASHES YOUR FRUSTRATION GROWS
WHEN THE SYSTEM'S NOT FREE, YOU WILL ALWAYS BE HOSED
JUST BOOT IT_ PUT A GNU SYSTEM ON,
AND BOOT IT, BOOT IT
OR PUT IT IN YOUR HORN, AND TOOT IT!

IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WAS TO BLAME
TILL YOU REBOOT IT, YOUR MACHINE'S LAME
JUST BOOT IT_ JUST BOOT IT_
JUST BOOT IT_ JUST BOOT IT_

IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU DID WRONG
TILL YOU REBOOT IT, YOUR MACHINE'S GONE
JUST BOOT IT_ BOOT IT_ BOOT IT_
